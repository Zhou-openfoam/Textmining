These two files are python3.x code to text mining and auto-extract 'Surface area' and 'Pore Volume' of given html file.

Those codes are not specialist level. So I wrote some comment for users.

1. After running the code, Users need to type input file name.
   Input html file name must be written in full name.(including '.html')

2. Input html files must be in the same folder with given codes.

3. Output format for surface area is basically in form of [MOF name, Surface type, Property value, Unit].
   Output format for pore volume is basically in form of [MOF name, Property value, Unit].

4. Users can delete 'temp.html' or 'temp2.html' like files after the output comes out.

Thank you
